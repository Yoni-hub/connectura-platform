## 1. Purpose of This Policy

This Data Sharing Policy explains **how, when, and with whom information is shared** on the Connsura platform. It is designed to provide transparency to Clients, Agents, regulators, and partners regarding Connsura’s data‑sharing practices.

Connsura is built on a **client‑controlled sharing model**: no insurance data is shared unless a Client explicitly authorizes it.

---

## 2. Core Principle: Client Controls Data

Connsura does not sell, rent, or distribute personal data.

All sharing is:

* **Initiated by the Client**
* **Purpose‑limited**
* **Revocable at any time**
* **Logged for audit and compliance**

Agents never receive access to data unless a Client grants permission through the platform.

---

## 3. What Data Can Be Shared

Depending on what the Client chooses to share, data may include:

* Contact information (name, email, phone)
* Address and location details
* Insurance profile information (auto, home, renters, commercial, etc.)
* Notes and messages exchanged with an Agent

Clients can choose **which categories** of data to share and may update or revoke access at any time.

---

## 4. Who Data Is Shared With

### 4.1 Licensed Insurance Agents

Data may be shared with Agents when:

* The Agent is verified and licensed
* The Client selects the Agent
* The Client explicitly grants access

Access is limited to the scope and duration defined by the Client.

### 4.2 Service Providers

Connsura shares limited data with vetted service providers strictly for platform operation, including:

* Cloud hosting and infrastructure
* Email delivery services
* Security monitoring and logging
* Database, backup, and recovery services

All service providers are contractually bound to:

* Use data only to provide services to Connsura
* Maintain confidentiality
* Apply industry‑standard security controls

---

## 5. Data Sharing Is Not Advertising

Connsura does **not**:

* Sell personal data
* Share data with advertisers
* Use data for behavioral advertising
* Share data for marketing unrelated services

---

## 6. Revoking Access

Clients may revoke an Agent’s access at any time through the platform.

When access is revoked:

* The Agent immediately loses platform access to the data
* Future updates are no longer visible
* Access revocation is logged for audit purposes

Agents are contractually required to delete or stop using Client data once access is revoked, except where retention is required by law.

---

## 7. Audit Logs and Compliance

Connsura maintains audit logs of:

* When data is shared
* Which Agent received access
* What categories of data were shared
* When access was revoked

These logs are retained to meet regulatory, security, and compliance requirements and may be provided to regulators upon lawful request.

---

## 8. Legal and Regulatory Disclosures

Connsura may disclose information when required to do so by:

* Law
* Court order
* Insurance regulators
* Law enforcement agencies

Such disclosures are limited to what is legally required and documented internally.

---

## 9. Data Minimization

Connsura follows a **data minimization policy**, meaning:

* Only necessary data is shared
* Access is limited in scope and duration
* Sensitive data is protected by additional controls

---

## 10. Security of Shared Data

All shared data is protected using:

* Encryption in transit and at rest
* Role‑based access control
* Continuous monitoring
* Secure authentication

Sharing does not reduce the level of protection applied to Client data.

---

## 11. Changes to This Policy

This Data Sharing Policy may be updated periodically. Material changes will be communicated through the platform or by email.
