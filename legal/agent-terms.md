# Agent Terms and Responsibilities

**Effective Date:** [Insert Date]

**Last Updated:** [Insert Date]

## 1. Purpose of These Terms

These Agent Terms and Responsibilities (“Agent Terms”) govern the use of the Connsura platform by licensed insurance professionals (“Agents”). By creating an Agent account or accessing client-shared information on Connsura, you agree to comply with these terms.

Connsura is a **technology platform only** and does not act as an insurance agency, broker, carrier, or intermediary. Agents remain fully responsible for their professional conduct, licensing, and compliance obligations.

## 2. Eligibility and Licensing Requirements

To use Connsura as an Agent, you must:

* Hold an active and valid insurance license in each state where you operate
* Maintain good standing with applicable state insurance regulators
* Provide accurate licensing information (e.g., license number, NPN)
* Promptly update your information if your status changes

Connsura may verify licensing information through public or third-party databases and may suspend or terminate access if licensing cannot be verified.

## 3. Permitted Use of Client Data

Agents may access Client information **only when a Client explicitly grants access** through the Connsura platform.

You agree that Client data may be used solely to:

* Provide insurance quotes or services requested by the Client
* Communicate with the Client regarding their insurance needs
* Fulfill lawful insurance-related transactions

You may not:

* Use Client data for unrelated marketing
* Share Client data with third parties without authorization
* Retain Client data after access is revoked (unless required by law)
* Download, scrape, or attempt to extract platform data in bulk

## 4. Confidentiality and Data Protection

Agents are required to:

* Maintain confidentiality of all Client information
* Protect data using reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards
* Prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse

Any suspected data breach must be reported immediately to **[security@connsura.com](mailto:security@connsura.com)**.

## 5. Access Revocation and Client Control

Clients may revoke your access at any time.

When access is revoked:

* You must immediately stop accessing Client data
* You must delete or cease using any Client data previously obtained
* You may not attempt to re-contact the Client using retained information unless legally permitted

Connsura logs all access and revocation events for audit purposes.

## 6. Professional Conduct

Agents agree to:

* Act in good faith and in the Client’s best interest
* Provide accurate, lawful, and non-misleading information
* Comply with all applicable insurance laws and regulations
* Avoid deceptive, abusive, or coercive practices

Connsura may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these standards.

## 7. No Endorsement or Ranking Guarantee

Connsura does not endorse any Agent, agency, or insurance product.

Any visibility, ratings, or placement on the platform are based on neutral factors such as:

* Client preferences
* Location
* Language
* Client-provided feedback

Connsura does not sell preferential placement or influence Agent selection.

## 8. Communications and Recordkeeping

Agents are responsible for maintaining their own records as required by law. Connsura may retain platform communication logs for security, compliance, and dispute resolution purposes.

## 9. Suspension and Termination

Connsura may suspend or terminate Agent access if:

* Licensing cannot be verified
* Terms are violated
* Misuse of data is detected
* Required by law or regulator request

Termination does not relieve Agents of legal obligations related to prior Client interactions.

## 10. Indemnification

Agents agree to indemnify and hold harmless Connsura from claims arising from:

* Agent misconduct
* Licensing violations
* Misrepresentation to Clients
* Failure to comply with laws or regulations

## 11. Limitation of Platform Role

Connsura provides tools for information sharing and communication only. Agents acknowledge that:

* All insurance advice is provided solely by the Agent
* All policies are issued by carriers, not Connsura
* Connsura is not responsible for insurance outcomes

## 12. Changes to These Terms

These Agent Terms may be updated periodically. Continued use of the platform constitutes acceptance of updates.
