About Connsura

Connsura is a technology platform designed to simplify how people organize, manage, and share their insurance information.

Buying or reviewing insurance often means filling out the same forms repeatedly, navigating unfamiliar terminology, and struggling to communicate clearly with licensed professionals. Connsura was built to solve that problem—without replacing or interfering with the insurance process itself.

What We Do

Connsura provides a secure digital Insurance Passport that allows individuals and families to:

Create and manage their insurance-related information in one place

Update details once instead of re-entering them repeatedly

Share their information securely with licensed insurance agents when they choose

Find independent agents based on language, location, or name

Communicate directly with agents using built-in messaging tools

All information shared through Connsura remains under the user’s control.

What We Do Not Do

To be clear:

Connsura does not sell insurance

We do not quote premiums or recommend policies

We do not negotiate coverage terms

We do not bind insurance or collect payments

We do not act on behalf of any insurance company

All insurance transactions occur directly between consumers and independently licensed insurance agents.

Our Role in the Insurance Ecosystem

Connsura serves as neutral infrastructure—a secure bridge between consumers and licensed professionals.

We support:

Consumers by reducing friction and improving clarity

Licensed agents by providing better-organized, client-approved information

We do not replace agents, carriers, or regulators.

Trust, Privacy & Control

Users own their data

Information is shared only with explicit consent

Access is logged and auditable

Security and privacy are foundational to our design

Trust is not a feature—it is the core of our platform.

Our Vision

We believe insurance should be easier to manage, easier to understand, and easier to communicate—without compromising regulation, professionalism, or consumer protection.

Connsura exists to modernize access, not bypass safeguards.

Connsura: Platform Overview & Regulatory Position
Company Overview

Connsura is an insurance technology (InsurTech) platform that enables consumers to digitally store, manage, and selectively share insurance-related information with independently licensed insurance producers.

Connsura operates exclusively as a technology and data-management platform and does not participate in insurance solicitation, negotiation, quoting, binding, or premium collection.

Platform Functionality

Connsura provides:

A secure consumer-managed insurance profile (“Insurance Passport”)

Consent-based data sharing with licensed agents

Agent discovery tools (language, geography, name)

Communication features supporting client-agent interaction

Auditability and access controls for shared information

All insurance-related decisions and transactions occur outside the Connsura platform.

Explicit Exclusions

Connsura does not:

Act as an insurance producer, broker, or agency

Represent insurers or underwrite risk

Provide policy recommendations or pricing

Receive commissions or compensation tied to policy placement

Collect or transmit insurance premiums

The platform is intentionally structured to avoid activities requiring insurance producer licensure.

Agent Relationship Model

All agents using Connsura are:

Independently licensed insurance producers

Responsible for their own regulatory compliance

Not employees, contractors, or representatives of Connsura

License verification may be performed for platform integrity, but Connsura does not sponsor, supervise, or control agent conduct.

Data Governance & Consumer Protection

Data ownership remains with the consumer

Information sharing is opt-in and revocable

Access is logged for transparency and audit purposes

Security controls align with industry best practices

Connsura’s compliance focus is centered on data protection, transparency, and consumer consent.

Regulatory Position Statement

Connsura should be classified as a non-regulated insurance technology service provider, similar to CRM platforms, data-management tools, and agent directories.

The platform does not engage in activities that constitute insurance solicitation or transaction under applicable state insurance laws.

Long-Term Vision

Connsura aims to become trusted infrastructure that supports licensed professionals while empowering consumers—without disrupting established regulatory frameworks.

Must clearly state:

Connsura is not an insurer, agency, or producer

No quoting, binding, or premium handling

Agents are independent and licensed

Use conservative, regulator-friendly language

Make fully admin-editable
