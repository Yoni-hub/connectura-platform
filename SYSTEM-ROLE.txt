About Connsura

Connsura is a secure insurance profile system designed to simplify how people organize, manage, and share their insurance information.

Buying or reviewing insurance often means filling out the same forms repeatedly, re-entering the same details, and struggling to keep documents organized. Connsura was built to solve that problem without replacing or interfering with the insurance process itself.

What We Do

Connsura provides a secure digital Insurance Passport that allows individuals and families to:

Create and manage their insurance information in one place
Update details once instead of re-entering them repeatedly
Store insurance records securely
Share their information with anyone they choose when needed

All information shared through Connsura remains under the user's control.

What We Do Not Do

To be clear:

Connsura does not sell insurance
We do not quote premiums or recommend policies
We do not negotiate coverage terms
We do not bind insurance or collect payments
We do not act on behalf of any insurance company

All insurance transactions occur outside the Connsura platform.

Our Role in the Insurance Ecosystem

Connsura serves as neutral infrastructure for organizing and sharing insurance information.

We support:

Consumers by reducing friction and improving clarity
Organizations that need accurate, consented insurance data

We do not recommend providers, route leads, or participate in insurance sales.

Trust, Privacy & Control

Users own their data
Information is shared only with explicit consent
Access is logged and auditable
Security and privacy are foundational to our design

Trust is not a feature - it is the core of our platform.

Our Vision

We believe insurance should be easier to manage, easier to understand, and easier to communicate without compromising regulation, professionalism, or consumer protection.

Connsura exists to modernize access, not bypass safeguards.

Structure it into clear sections:

Connsura: Platform Overview & Regulatory Position
Company Overview

Connsura is an insurance technology (InsurTech) platform that enables consumers to digitally store, manage, and selectively share insurance-related information.

Connsura operates exclusively as a technology and data-management platform and does not participate in insurance solicitation, negotiation, quoting, binding, or premium collection.

Platform Functionality

Connsura provides:

A secure consumer-managed insurance profile ("Insurance Passport")
Consent-based data sharing
Document organization and exportable records
Access controls and audit logs for shared information

All insurance-related decisions and transactions occur outside the Connsura platform.

Explicit Exclusions

Connsura does not:

Act as an insurance producer, broker, or agency
Represent insurers or underwrite risk
Provide policy recommendations or pricing
Receive commissions or compensation tied to policy placement
Collect or transmit insurance premiums

The platform is intentionally structured to avoid activities requiring insurance producer licensure.

Recipient Relationship Model

All recipients of shared information are chosen by the consumer.

Connsura does not recommend providers, rank recipients, route leads, or supervise third parties.

Data Governance & Consumer Protection

Data ownership remains with the consumer
Information sharing is opt-in and revocable
Access is logged for transparency and audit purposes
Security controls align with industry best practices

Connsura's compliance focus is centered on data protection, transparency, and consumer consent.

Regulatory Position Statement

Connsura should be classified as a non-regulated insurance technology service provider, similar to CRM platforms and consumer data-management tools.

The platform does not engage in activities that constitute insurance solicitation or transaction under applicable state insurance laws.

Long-Term Vision

Connsura aims to become trusted infrastructure that supports accurate, consented data sharing while empowering consumers without disrupting established regulatory frameworks.

Must clearly state:

Connsura is not an insurer, agency, or producer

No quoting, binding, or premium handling

Recipients are chosen by the consumer

Use conservative, regulator-friendly language
