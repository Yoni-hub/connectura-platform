  "long_term_memory": "Tech:\n- React 19 with Vite 7 (connsura-frontend).\n- Tailwind CSS.\n\nAPI:\n- API base in src/services/api.js uses VITE_API_URL or http://localhost:8000.\n- Axios adds Authorization: Bearer <connsura_token> from localStorage.\n\nRoutes (AppRouter):\n- Public: /, /agents, /agents/:id, /contact, /careers, /privacy-policy, /legal-notice, /recover, /admin, /share/:token.\n- Auth-protected: /dashboard, /client/dashboard, /agent/dashboard, /agent/onboarding,\n  /call/video/:id, /call/voice/:id.\n- /profile/create now uses the custom CreateProfile page (no backend redirect).\n\nRoles:\n- CUSTOMER and AGENT roles; agent access gated by approval/suspension.\n\nDecisions:\n- Vite preview serves frontend on port 4173 in staging, behind Nginx.\n- VITE_API_URL provided at build time in deploy script.\n- Homepage uses a shared background image with a layered 3D gradient (bg-3d) on hero and key sections; middle/trust cards are translucent over the background.\n- CreateProfile page uses section navigation (Household, Address, Vehicle, Business) with add buttons; only one section/form visible at a time.\n- Each section opens a modal-style card form sized to its content; Save & Continue produces full-width summary cards with per-entry edit/remove and Add More flows.\n- Household summary shows Full Name, Birthday, Sex, License Number; Address summary shows Phone #1, Email Address #1, Street Address 1; contact info lives in the Address step.\n- Employment selection filters occupations, with Homemaker/Student/Retired mapping to same-named occupation.\n- Homepage and navbar Create your insurance profile open customer auth modal and redirect to /client/dashboard?tab=forms after auth.\n- Client dashboard reads tab query param; share is gated by email verification with OTP UI.\n- Forgot password opens /recover; recovery auto-logs in after reset.\n- Settings include authenticator setup panel and Overview reminder when not enabled.\n- CreateProfile prefills named insured name and Address contact email from signup; default relation is Named Insured.\n- CreateProfile forms auto-save to customer.profileData.forms on the client dashboard.\n- Share modal supports read-only vs allow edits; public link requires recipient name; share link unlock requires code + name when set.\n- Share link page shows summary or editable CreateProfile limited to shared sections; Save changes sends approval request, modal shows status after save only.\n- Client dashboard auto-opens review modal for pending edits and shows active share banner with per-recipient stop buttons.\n- Auth gating waits for /auth/me to finish so refresh stays on the current protected route.\n- Internal preferred-agent save/share UI removed (no Save preferred, no saved-agent panel, no Share profile button on agent profile).\n- Agent dashboard header no longer shows the avatar badge next to Log out.\n- Favicon uses logo-based assets (favicon-16/32, apple-touch-icon in /public).\n\nOpen questions:\n- Production frontend hosting strategy not documented.\n- Real-time messaging/notifications not defined.\n\nNext steps:\n- Keep UI aligned with backend API changes.\n- Update memory after major frontend changes.",
