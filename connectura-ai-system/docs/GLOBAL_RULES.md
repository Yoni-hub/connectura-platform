# Connectura Global Rules

- Connectura does NOT sell insurance.
- Quotes & policies are handled on agents’ own systems.
- Platform connects clients ↔ licensed agents.
- Core features:
  1) Language-based matching
  2) Client insurance profiles (create once, securely share)
- Separate onboarding + dashboards for Clients and Agents.
- Require auth only when necessary.
- Onboarding precedes dashboards.
- Use intent-based redirects.
